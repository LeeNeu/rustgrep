# Rustgrep - grep written in Rust

Rustgrep is the linux command-line tool "grep" rewritten in Rust with basic features.  
If grep is unfamiliar to you check out: [How To Geek: grep](https://www.howtogeek.com/496056/how-to-use-the-grep-command-on-linux/).

## Purpose

I created this project in order to learn Rust. Therefore it is by far not mature or comparable to grep in this stage.  
With this project I am trying to learn the concepts of Rust and also enhance my knowledge about software engineering in general.  
Furthermore it should serve for other Rust Beginners as an oppurtunity to learn Rust and learn from other peoples code.

## Goals ðŸš€

- Let rustgrep be a fully functional substitution to the original grep
- Create a standalone cli tool from this project.
- To let collaborators have fun while learning rust on this project

## Install

To run this project: 
1. Pull Project from Github
2. In the Terminal run: 'cargo run -- help'

This will output the help section of the Rustgrep CLI.
